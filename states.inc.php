/*
   Game state machine is a tool used to facilitate game development by handling common tasks
   in an easy way through this configuration file.

   Summary of state types:
   - activeplayer: The game expects an action from a single active player.
   - multipleactiveplayer: The game expects actions from multiple active players.
   - game: An intermediary state where no player action is expected. The game logic decides the next state.
   - manager: Special type for initial and final states.

   State arguments:
   - name: The unique name of the GameState, used in the code.
   - description: Displayed in the action status bar at the top of the game (usually irrelevant for "game" states).
   - descriptionmyturn: Description displayed when it is the current player's turn.
   - type: Defines the type of state (activeplayer / multipleactiveplayer / game / manager).
   - action: The method called when entering this game state. Usually prefixed by "st" (e.g., "stMyGameState").
   - possibleactions: List of possible player actions in this state. Allows usage of "checkAction" on both
     client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (PHP).
   - transitions: Defines the possible transitions from this state to another. The transitions must be named,
     and their values are the corresponding state IDs.
   - args: The method that provides arguments for this game state. These are sent to the client for use in 
     "onEnteringState" or setting arguments in the game state description.
   - updateGameProgression: If set, the game progression is updated (calls `getGameProgression` method).
